                  We believe that your privacy is a fundamental right. We have written this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to reflect our values, and to clearly describe what information we collect from you when you use our specially-developed smart contracts to contribute to a Piggy, break the Piggy, and withdraw your funds in case of victory, through a website (www.piggybreaker.com) that users can interact with (the “Site”), as well as how we protect and use that information. The smart contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “App”. By using the App, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to the App, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the App. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While our values will not shift, the App will evolve over time, and this Policy will change to reflect that evolution. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy. In some cases, if we make significant changes, we may give you additional notice by adding a statement to our homepage, or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.
                </p>

                <h2 class="grey-text">Information Collection</h2>
                <h3 class="grey-text">Information We Do Collect</h3>
                <p>
                  We will ask you to provide us with your email address, and your Ethereum wallet address. We also collect basic analytics and log-in information when you use the App. This sort of information may be collected from third-party providers like Facebook or Google Analytics, and includes, among other things, the type of device you use, access times, IP address, hardware model, operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers. Some of these third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the App might be affected.
                </p>
