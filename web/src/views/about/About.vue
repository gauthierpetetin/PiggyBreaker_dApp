                  CryptoPiggies is the simplest blockchain game ever seen:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>1) You contribute with ether (ETH) to fill the piggy bank and get a chance to win the lottery</li>
                  <li>2) The lottery is launched when the piggy gets broken</li>
                  <li>3) The winner is chosen “randomly” between all contributors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, CryptoPiggies introduces a new concept in regard of traditional lotteries : YOU are the one who decides your chances to win.<br />
                  The more you contribute, the more chances you have to win.<br />
                  Indeed, an algorithm sets chances to win proportional to player’s individual contributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  CryptoPiggies is a blockchain game. ‘Blockchain’ is the technology that makes things like Bitcoin possible. It offers total security “by design”, which ensures the piggy content cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.
